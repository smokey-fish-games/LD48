# Author notes (you don't need to read this if you don't want)
Inspired by point and click adventure games like the monkey island series, Mystery of the druids & Night of the tentacle.
I really wanted to add more to this but like all game jams i ran out of time (or more appropriately energy). From the start i wanted to do something that wasn't a 2D platformer/top down and decided to try my hand at point and click. Overall i think i did a good job building up the backend code to move the character, interact with objects, etc but of course all of that is stuff you as a player don't see! It's a shame it's short but i'm happy with the outcome!

I hope you enjoyed the game and i look forward to reading your comments and constructive feedback!
